# LLMem

LLMem is a structured memory system (Go binary). It stores factual memories in SQLite with optional embedding-based semantic search via Ollama (nomic-embed-text). Semantic search uses a sqlite-vec HNSW ANN index for sub-linear retrieval, with automatic fallback to brute-force cosine similarity if the sqlite-vec extension is not available. Memories can be connected via typed relations (`related_to`, `supersedes`, `contradicts`, `depends_on`, `derived_from`). A background dreaming/consolidation system (light, deep, REM phases) runs automatically via systemd timer to decay idle memories, boost frequent ones, promote high-value ones, and merge near-duplicates.

## Installation

- **CLI:** `~/.local/bin/llmem`
- **Config:** `~/.config/llmem/config.yaml`
- **DB:** `~/.config/llmem/memory.db`
- **Ollama:** `http://localhost:11434` (local, for embeddings)

## Session Adapter Configuration

LLMem uses a session adapter to read conversation transcripts for memory extraction. Set `session.adapter` in config.yaml:

- `opencode` (default) — reads from `~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db`. Auto-selected if the database exists.
- `copilot` — reads from `~/.copilot/session-state/`. Auto-selected if only Copilot session data exists. Full transcripts require `--share`.
- `none` — no adapter. Context injection still works, but transcript extraction returns `no_transcript`.

```yaml
# For Copilot CLI:
session:
  adapter: copilot
copilot:
  state_dir: ~/.copilot/session-state
  share_dir: .
```

`llmem init` auto-detects the adapter type based on which session state directory exists.

## Memory Types

| Type | Use for |
|------|---------|
| fact | Objective truths, definitions, state of the world |
| decision | Choices made and their rationale |
| preference | User preferences, style choices |
| event | Things that happened at a point in time |
| project_state | Current status of a project or system |
| procedure | How-to knowledge, step sequences |
| conversation | Notable conversation outcomes or commitments |
| self_assessment | Structured introspective records — error patterns, behavioral corrections, recurring mistakes, proposed procedural updates |

## Error Taxonomy

Self-assessment memories are categorized using a standard error taxonomy. Each category identifies a class of mistake that the introspection system tracks for pattern detection:

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| NULL_SAFETY | Missing null/None/undefined checks before property access or method calls |
| ERROR_HANDLING | Missing try/except, bare except, swallowed errors, unhandled promise rejections |
| OFF_BY_ONE | Boundary errors, wrong loop bounds, fencepost errors |
| RACE_CONDITION | Concurrency issues, async/await problems, missing locks |
| AUTH_BYPASS | Missing auth checks, SSRF, injection vulnerabilities, security oversights |
| DATA_INTEGRITY | Stale derived fields, out-of-sync caches/embeddings/indexes, source-of-truth divergence |
| MISSING_VERIFICATION | Skipped test steps, unverified outputs, assumed-it-works |
| EDGE_CASE | Unhandled empty input, unexpected types, boundary values |
| PERFORMANCE | N+1 queries, unnecessary recomputation, memory leaks |
| DESIGN | Architectural issues, wrong abstraction level, coupling problems |
| REVIEW_PASSED | Clean review with no findings — positive outcome for tracking purposes |

## Structured self_assessment Format

Self-assessment memories follow a structured format with nine fields:

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Category | Yes | Taxonomy category from the Error Taxonomy above (e.g. `NULL_SAFETY`, `ERROR_HANDLING`) |
| Context | No | Where and when — file, task, session date |
| What_happened | Yes | Behavioral description, not narrative |
| Outcomes | No | What were the results? Did things work on first try or require iterations? |
| What_caught_it | No | How the error was discovered (`self-review`, `test`, `user`, `CI`) |
| Estimates_vs_actual | No | Was the complexity assessment accurate? Did tasks take more or less effort? |
| Recurring | No | `yes` or `no`; if yes, reference past self_assessment IDs |
| Proposed_update | No | Specific procedural directive to prevent recurrence |
| Iteration_count | No | How many attempts before success (integer). 1 = first try, 2 = one retry, etc. |

## Relations

Memories can be linked by typed relations: `supersedes`, `contradicts`, `depends_on`, `related_to`, `derived_from`.

Relations are managed internally by the dream system and extraction pipeline. The Go backend supports relation traversal in search (exposed via the `Retriever` API) but the CLI does not yet expose `--traverse-relations` as a flag.

### Multi-Signal Reranking

After RRF fusion, search results are automatically reranked using a blend of the RRF score and four weighted signals:

```
final_score = rrf_score * (1 - blend) + weighted_signal * blend
```

**Default blend factor: 0.3** (70% RRF, 30% signals).

**Signals and weights:**

| Signal | Weight | Formula |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Confidence | 0.4 | Direct use of `confidence` field (0.0–1.0, default 0.0) |
| Recency | 0.3 | `exp(-0.01 * days_since_access)` (0.0 if never accessed) |
| Access frequency | 0.2 | `log(1 + access_count / max(age_days, 1))` (0.0 if never accessed) |
| Type priority | 0.1 | Lookup in `TYPE_PRIORITY` dict (default 1.0 for unknown types) |

**Type priority weights:**

| Type | Priority |
|------|----------|
| decision | 1.2 |
| preference | 1.1 |
| procedure | 1.1 |
| fact | 1.0 |
| project_state | 1.0 |
| self_assessment | 1.0 |
| event | 0.9 |
| conversation | 0.7 |

## Important Notes

- **Go binary** — `llmem` is now a compiled Go binary at `~/.local/bin/llmem`, symlinked from `/usr/local/bin/llmem`. No Python virtualenv needed.
- **Invalidate, don't delete** unless the memory was wrong. Invalidated memories stay for reference but aren't returned in searches.
- **Embeddings** require Ollama running with `nomic-embed-text` pulled. If Ollama is down, semantic search falls back to FTS5-only.
- **ANN vector index** — semantic search uses sqlite-vec (`vec0` virtual table) for fast ANN retrieval, with automatic fallback to brute-force cosine similarity if sqlite-vec is not available.
- **Confidence** is 0.0-1.0. Higher = more certain. Facts from the user directly should be 0.9+, auto-extracted should be 0.7.
- **Context generation** is what gets injected into the system prompt for context. Use `llmem context --session-id <id>` to preview what gets injected.
- **Session hooks** use `llmem hook --type <idle|created|ending|compacting> --session-id <id>`. The idle hook processes the session's transcript, extracts memories, and runs introspection automatically.
- **Access tracking** — `llmem get` is read-only and does not update `access_count` or `accessed_at`. Search operations automatically track access — each returned result's `access_count` and `accessed_at` are updated (best-effort).
- **Calibration status metadata** — procedure memories created by behavioral insights receive `calibration_status` (trend: `decreasing`, `stable`, or `increasing`) and `calibrated_at` metadata when calibration runs. Stale procedures get `stale_procedure: true` and `stale_at` metadata. These are visible via `llmem get <id>`.
- **Review outcome tracking** — `llmem track-review` persists review findings as `self_assessment` memories. Three modes: `--single` for a single finding, `--findings <file>` for batch from JSON, or no flags for a clean review (creates `REVIEW_PASSED` memory). Use `--clean` to invalidate all existing track-review memories before storing new ones.


## Dream — Background Consolidation

The dream system is an automated memory maintenance pipeline that runs three phases:

- **Light** — finds near-duplicates using cosine similarity (configurable threshold, default 0.92). Produces merge candidates for the deep phase.
- **Deep** — decays idle memories (confidence decreases over time), boosts frequently accessed memories, promotes high-scoring memories, and merges near-duplicates using LLM-assisted merge with fallback to concatenation.
- **REM** — extracts themes and clusters from memory, writes a human-readable dream diary to `~/.config/llmem/dream-diary.md`. Self-assessment memories are grouped by error taxonomy category (e.g. "2 self_assessment memories about NULL_SAFETY") for pattern detection. When a category has 3+ occurrences (configurable via `skill_patch_threshold`), the REM phase generates three outputs: (1) a **procedural memory** (Tier 1 — automatic, low confidence), (2) a **behavioral insight** entry in `proposed-changes.md` (Tier 2 — human review), and (3) a **skill patch** entry in `proposed-changes.md` marked with `[SKILL PATCH]` (Tier 3 — human review). Skill patches are structured markdown snippets with Detection Rule, Checklist, Pitfall, and Verification sections that can be appended to existing skills or used as mini-skills. They are NOT auto-applied — they require human review and deployment. When behavioral insights are generated, **calibration tracking** compares self_assessment error rates (or average iteration counts) before and after each adaptation was introduced, marking them as effective (decreasing) or ineffective (stable/increasing). Procedure memories that are never accessed and older than `stale_procedure_days` are aggressively decayed (confidence reduced at double the normal decay rate). The dream diary includes a `### Calibration` section with per-category effectiveness and stale procedure counts.

**Default mode is dry-run** — use `--apply` to actually make changes. Without it, `llmem dream` only previews what would happen. Use `--report /path/to/report.html` to generate an HTML dream report.

**Scheduling**: A systemd user timer (`llmem-dream.timer`) runs `llmem dream --apply` nightly at 3am. See `harness/llmem-dream.service` and `harness/llmem-dream.timer`.

**Dream config** lives under the `dream:` key in `~/.config/llmem/config.yaml`:

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `similarity_threshold` | 0.92 | Cosine similarity for near-duplicate detection |
| `decay_rate` | 0.05 | Confidence reduction per decay interval |
| `decay_interval_days` | 30 | Days per decay interval |
| `decay_floor` | 0.3 | Minimum confidence after decay |
| `confidence_floor` | 0.3 | Memories at or below this are invalidated |
| `boost_threshold` | 5 | Access count that triggers confidence boost |
| `boost_amount` | 0.05 | Confidence boost amount |
| `diary_path` | ~/.config/llmem/dream-diary.md | Path to dream diary file |
| `report_path` | (none) | Path for HTML dream report output |
| `behavioral_threshold` | 3 | Minimum self_assessment occurrences to trigger behavioral insight |
| `behavioral_lookback_days` | 30 | Days of self_assessment memories for behavioral insights |
| `auto_link_threshold` | (none) | Cosine similarity threshold for auto-linking related memories |
