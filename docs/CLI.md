**Python-only commands** (not yet in the Go CLI): `register-type`, `types`, `note`, `inbox`, `consolidate`, `embed`, `learn` (codebase indexing), `suggest-categories`.

### `llmem add`

```bash
llmem add --type TYPE --content TEXT [--summary TEXT] [--source SOURCE] \
  [--confidence FLOAT] [--valid-until TIMESTAMP] [--metadata JSON] \
  [--file PATH]
```

- `--type`: Memory type (default: `fact`).
- `--content` or `--file`: The memory text, or read content from a file. Files in protected system directories (e.g. `/etc`, `/bin`, `/usr/bin`) are blocked to prevent arbitrary file reads.
- `--summary`: Memory summary.
- `--source`: Source of the memory (default: `manual`).
- `--confidence`: Confidence score 0–1 (default: 0.8).
- `--valid-until`: ISO 8601 timestamp for validity expiration.
- `--metadata`: JSON metadata string.
- `--file`: Read content from a file path. The path is resolved and validated against system directory traversal.

### `llmem search`

```bash
llmem search QUERY [--type TYPE] [--limit N] [--json] [--valid-only] \
  [--fts-only | --semantic-only]
```

Hybrid search combining FTS5 keyword search and vector semantic search via Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF).

- `--type`: Filter by memory type.
- `--limit`: Maximum results (default: 20).
- `--json`: Output results as JSON.
- `--valid-only`: Only show valid (not invalidated) memories.
- `--fts-only`: Use FTS5 keyword search only (no embedder needed).
- `--semantic-only`: Use semantic (embedding) search only (requires an embedder).

Without `--fts-only` or `--semantic-only`, the default mode is FTS5-only (since the Go CLI currently sets `DisableVec: true`). Python supports full hybrid mode with `--include-code`, `--traverse-refs`, and `--provider` flags.

### `llmem list`

```bash
llmem list [--type TYPE] [--all] [--limit N]
```

By default, excludes expired memories. Use `--all` to include them. `--limit` defaults to 100.

### `llmem stats`

Shows total, active, and expired memory counts, plus a breakdown by type. Use `--json` for JSON output.

### `llmem update`

```bash
llmem update ID [--content TEXT] [--summary TEXT] [--confidence FLOAT] \
  [--valid-until TIMESTAMP] [--metadata JSON]
```

Only fields with `--` flags are updated; omitted fields remain unchanged.

### `llmem invalidate`

```bash
llmem invalidate ID [--reason TEXT]
```

Marks a memory as no longer valid, with an optional reason.

### `llmem delete`

```bash
llmem delete ID
```

Permanently removes a memory (and its embeddings, FTS index entries, relations).

### `llmem export` / `llmem import`

```bash
llmem export [--output FILE] [--limit N]
llmem import FILE
```

Export produces a JSON array of all memories (default limit: 10,000). Import validates that each entry has `type` and `content` string fields before inserting.

- `--output FILE`: Write export to a file. The output path is validated against traversal attacks.
- `--limit N`: Maximum memories to export (default: 10000).
- Import `FILE`: Path to a JSON file. Files are validated against system directory traversal. The file must be under 10 MiB.

### `llmem metrics`

```bash
llmem metrics
```

Report the count of embeddings stored in the database. In the Go CLI, this command outputs the number of embedded memories. For full embedding quality metrics (anisotropy, similarity range, discrimination gap), use the Python CLI's `llmem embed` command.

### `llmem dream`

```bash
llmem dream [--apply] [--phase light|deep|rem] [--report PATH]
```

Run the dream consolidation cycle, which performs automated memory maintenance in three phases:

- **Light phase:** Sort and deduplicate near-duplicate memories (cosine similarity ≥ `dream.similarity_threshold`).
- **Deep phase:** Score, promote, decay, and merge memories. Also promotes inbox items to long-term memory (items with attention_score ≥ `dream.min_score` become permanent; lower-scored items are evicted). Decays confidence on idle memories. Boosts frequently accessed memories. Performs LLM-assisted merging of similar pairs. Auto-links memories with high cosine similarity (≥ `dream.auto_link_threshold`, default 0.85).
- **REM phase:** Extract themes from memory clusters and write a dream diary (read-only reflection). Produces type counts, word clusters, and total/active memory counts.

Without `--apply`, the dream cycle runs as a **dry run** — output is prefixed with `[DRY RUN]` and no changes are written to the database.

Flags:

- `--apply`: Apply changes. Without this flag, the dream cycle runs as a dry run (no modifications to the database).
- `--phase`: Run a specific dream phase only. Choices: `light`, `deep`, `rem`. Default: all phases.
- `--report PATH`: Write an HTML dream report to the given path. The path is validated — it must not target a protected system directory (e.g. `/etc`, `/var`), contain `..` traversal, or be a symlink. Paths outside the llmem home directory are allowed (e.g. custom report output locations). On validation failure, prints an error to stderr and exits with code 1.

All dream configuration (thresholds, model, schedule, etc.) is read from the `dream:` section of `config.yaml` (see [Configuration](../docs/CONFIGURATION.md)).

Output is printed to stdout. On `--report` path validation errors, the error message is printed to stderr.

> **Python-only commands:** The Python CLI includes additional commands not yet in the Go CLI: `register-type`, `types`, `note`, `inbox`, `consolidate`, `embed` (full embedding quality metrics), `learn` (codebase indexing), and `suggest-categories`.

### `llmem context`

```bash
llmem context --session-id ID [--compacting]
```

Inject relevant memory context for a session. Used by session hooks to inject memories into a new or compacting session.

- `--session-id` (required): The session ID to inject context for. Validated against path traversal attacks.
- `--compacting`: If set, inject key memories for compaction instead of session start context. High-confidence memories of types `decision`, `preference`, `procedure`, and `project_state` (confidence ≥ 0.7) are selected.

### `llmem hook`

```bash
llmem hook --type TYPE --session-id ID
```

Handle session lifecycle hook events. Supports four hook types:

- `--type` (required): Hook type. Choices: `created`, `idle`, `compacting`, `ending`.
- `--session-id` (required): Session ID for the hook event. Validated against path traversal attacks.

The `idle` hook processes the session's transcript, extracts memories via the extraction pipeline (chunk → dedup → LLM extract → embed → store), and generates embedding vectors for each extracted memory. It uses a debounce mechanism (via `extraction_log` table) to prevent re-extraction. When `ExtractionEngine` is not configured, extraction is skipped gracefully.

The `ending` hook extracts memories from the transcript (same pipeline as `idle`).
